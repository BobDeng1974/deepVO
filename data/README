Go to: http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php

and download the odometry data set (color), odometry data set (calibration files), and odometry ground truth poses. Extract all of the data into the data/ folder.

The docker container has the project root mounted, so this data will be accessible from the container.

This data can not be stored in version control, as it is around 66 GB.
